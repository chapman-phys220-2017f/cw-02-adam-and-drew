# Instructor notes

Looking good overall.  Your notebook is incomplete. Look at the template in the info repository to get ideas for how to format it. You will want to import your python code then run it in the notebook to cleanly display the results. There should be no need for the code in the main blocks you have when done properly, though that code could be kept for running the programs on the command line.
